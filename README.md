# Naive Bayes: Whatsapp messages classification

## Abstract

Using the Whatsapp conversation history, we aim at predicting which member of a group sent a given message.
This procedure is inspired by the spam email classifier from the Probability and Statistics for Machine Learning and Data Science by DeepLearning.ai


## Method
The classification of messages will use the Bayes theorem under some coarse assumptions. The mathematical and implementation details are explained in the Jupyter Notebook
